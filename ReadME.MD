Hi there! In this project, I will be utilizing SQL and Tableau to comeplete the Data Cleaning and Analysis Project with the Credit Card Data source from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers/data 

Data Cleaning Steps:
1. Check if there's any null value
2. Rename the column make it easier to understand
3. Rename the value from Income_Category


Data Analysis Steps:
